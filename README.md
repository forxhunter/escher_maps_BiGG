# Escher Maps for BiGG Models

This repository contains autogenerated metabolic maps for BiGG models.
Maps are decomposed into subsystems and also provided as a combined global layout.

## Structure
- `{Model_ID}/`
  - `{Model_ID}_Combined.json`: Global tiled map.
  - `{Model_ID}_{Subsystem}.json`: Individual subsystem map.
